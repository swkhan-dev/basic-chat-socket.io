# basic-chat-socket.io
Just started using socket.io and I developed this simple chat website from their documentation with a small add-on.

## Steps to follow
1. Start the express server with socket.io server mounted on by running index.js.
2. The server serves an html page on port 3000
3. Open multiple clients(html pages)
4. Do some chatting
hurrah! you are done with basic realtime-chat using socket.io
