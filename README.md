# basic-chat-socket.io
Just started using socket.io and I developed this simple chat website from their documentation with a small add-on.

## Steps to follow
1. Run npm install in cmd to install required packages.
2. Start the express server with socket.io server mounted on by running index.js using npm start command.
3. The server serves an html page on port 3000
4. Open multiple clients(html pages)
5. Do some chatting
hurrah! you are done with basic realtime-chat using socket.io
